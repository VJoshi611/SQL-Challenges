176. Second Highest Salary
Medium

Table: Employee
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
 
Write a solution to find the second highest distinct salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in Pandas).

The result format is in the following example.
Example 1:
Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+

Example 2:
Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+


Solution 1] Using Sub-Query:
SELECT MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee);

Solution 2] Using Joins:
SELECT max(a.salary) as SecondHighestSalary
FROM employee AS a JOIN employee AS b
ON a.salary < b.salary

Solution 3] Using DENSE_RANK Function :
SELECT IFNULL(
    (SELECT DISTINCT salary
     FROM (
         SELECT salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk
         FROM Employee
     ) t
     WHERE t.rnk = 2), NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary;

Solution 4] Using Sub-Query:
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select max(salary) as SecondHighestSalary 
from Employee 
where salary not in 
  (
    select max(salary) from Employee
  )

Solution 5] Using CTE:
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS r,
        salary
    FROM Employee
)
SELECT 
    MAX(CASE WHEN r = 2 THEN salary ELSE NULL END) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM cte;
