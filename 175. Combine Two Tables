Problem: 175. Combine Two Tables
Goal: Write a SQL query that provides the following information for each person in the Person table,
      regardless of whether they have an address in the Address table:
      - FirstName
      - LastName
      - City
      - State

Tables:
1. Person
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| PersonId    | int     |
| FirstName   | varchar |
| LastName    | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
PersonId is the primary key column for this table.

2. Address
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| AddressId   | int     |
| PersonId    | int     |
| City        | varchar |
| State       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
AddressId is the primary key column for this table.

Approach:
Use a LEFT JOIN to combine the two tables.
This ensures that we retrieve all persons from the Person table,
including those who do not have a corresponding address in the Address table.
If there is no address for a person, the City and State will be NULL.

SQL Query:
SELECT 
    p.FirstName,      -- Person's first name
    p.LastName,       -- Person's last name
    a.City,           -- Associated city from the Address table, or NULL if no address
    a.State           -- Associated state from the Address table, or NULL if no address
FROM 
    Person p          -- Start from the Person table
LEFT JOIN 
    Address a         -- Perform a LEFT JOIN with the Address table
    ON p.PersonId = a.PersonId;  -- Match rows based on PersonId

Explanation:
The LEFT JOIN ensures that even if a person does not have an address, 
they will still appear in the results, with NULL values for the City and State.
